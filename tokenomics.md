<summary>What are the tokenomics of HYPR?</summary>

The HYPR token has a fixed supply of 100,000,000 tokens, allocated in the following ways:

* 70,000,000 (70%) was allocated to the uniswap v2 pool in a fair launch manner, which means that the team had access to buy the tokens at the same time and price as the general public. The team had no information or time advantage.&#x20;
* 30,000,000 (30%) was set aside to be used for retroactive rewards for developers and users and partners that deploy their app on Hypr Network.

Our goal is to create a network that is owned by its community members, but balanced in a way to also reward developers and users of applications that deploy on Hypr Network.\
\
Our goal is sustainable growth as a network and the 30% in a multisig wallet will allow Hypr to grow responsibly.&#x20;

<summary>What is the purchase limit per wallet address? Why have that?</summary>

The purchase amount limit per wallet address is 100,000 $HYPR Tokens. The reason for this limit are as follows:

* As a fair launch project, the initial market capitalization is very low. Putting purchase limits prevents any single actor to acquire a meaningfully large amount of the liquidity pool.&#x20;
* By setting limits, we are purposely putting the community first by creating an environment of healthy buying, selling, trading, swapping, and holding. We want holders of $HYPR to be both small and large and anything in between. At bottom, we want things fair and also broadly inclusive. We want everyone involved and participate in the Hypr Network.&#x20;

<summary>Is Uniswap Liquidity locked? Tell me more.</summary>

The Hypr team plans on locking the uniswap v2 LP tokens. In terms of timing, we do not have an ETA on that but, rest assured, we plan on locking liquidity within 7 days of creating the uniswap v2 pool.&#x20;

We are working with Floki team, the creator of Flokifi, the well-known and respected locker for liquidity.&#x20;

We will share more information as this becomes more relevant.

<summary>How does Revenue Sharing work? </summary>

* User must hold a minimum of 100,000 HYPR tokens.&#x20;
  * Once per week, we will do an unannounced snapshot. At the end of the calendar month, we will take the average of snapshots and the average of all snapshots taken must be at least 100,000 or greater to qualify for the revshare.
* No staking or lockup. Just hold the tokens in a non-custodial wallet (i.e., NOT a centralized exchange (CEX) wallet address like Binance).&#x20;
* Revenue share is distributed in $HYPR by default.
* Users have 14 days to claim. After the claim period, the $HYPR rewards will be burned. The team will do its best to remind users to claim and announce publicly during the 14 day claim period.&#x20;

Later, per our product roadmap, we plan on adding a Lock feature where the user is able to lock their HYPR tokens for a boost on their rewards.&#x20;

Claim rewards launching soon.

<summary>How much revenue share will I get?</summary>

How much you will get depends on the following:

* How much sell volume there was of the $HYPR token during the calendar month. This is true because sell volume determines revenue amount that goes into revshare wallet.
* How much $HYPR Tokens you held for the given calendar month.

More specifically,&#x20;

* You will receive a proportional share of rewards based on the number of HYPR tokens held, but a minimum of 100,000 $HYPR is required to be eligible.&#x20;
* For example let’s assume there are 5 users that qualify for revenue sharing in October and the number of HYPR tokens each owns:
  * BAM BAM: 200,000 HYPR Tokens
  * Loki, 500,000 HYPR Tokens
  * Victoria, 400,000 HYPR Tokens
  * Mina, 700,000 HYPR Tokens
  * Augustus, 1,000,000 HYPR Tokens

There are a total of 100,000 $HYPR in the rewards wallet, collected from Sell orders of HYPR tokens in the month of October. This means, each qualifying user gets:&#x20;

In other words,&#x20;

* Bam Bam had 200,000 HYPR Tokens during the snapshot month. This means, based on total number of eligible holders, he gets 7.14% of the rewards. Because the rewards wallet had 100,000 $HYPR, he gets 7142 $HYPR as his rewards.

<summary>What is my Revenue Share composed of?</summary>

* As of this writing (Oct 30, 2023), revenue share is comprised primarily of tax revenue. This means for every sell of $HYPR tokens, the transaction is taxed 5%, broken out in the following ways:
  * 1% goes back to the Uniswap v2 liquidity pool.
  * 2% goes toward revenue sharing.
  * 2% goes toward operating expenses such as marketing and business development.

<details>

<summary>What are the benefits of holding HYPR? </summary>

* You can qualify for the monthly revshare.
* Eventually, holding $HYPR Tokens will allow you to participate in governance decisions and vote on proposals. Hypr Network is community-owned, which means you get a voice in which the direction the protocol should go.

<summary>How do I qualify for rewards?</summary>

We've [answered this question here](tokenomics.md#how-does-revenue-sharing-work).

<details>

<summary>When can I claim my rewards? </summary>

Snapshots will be taken during the month. If your wallet qualifies and has at least 100,000 $HYPR Tokens and the revshare wallet has sufficient rewards to distribute to holders, then the rewards claim will be available in the first 7 days of the following month.

For example, it is November. During November, snapshots will be taken. At the end of the month, the average of the snapshots for any given wallet will be taken to determine eligibility. If eligible, then claim will be open in the first 7 days of December to claim for the month of November.
