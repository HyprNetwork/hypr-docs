<summary>What are the tokenomics of HYPR?</summary>

The HYPR token has a fixed supply of 100,000,000 tokens, allocated in the following ways:

* 70,000,000 (70%) was allocated to the uniswap v2 pool in a fair launch manner, which means that the team had access to buy the tokens at the same time and price as the general public. The team had no information or time advantage.&#x20;
* 30,000,000 (30%) was set aside to be used for retroactive rewards for developers and users and partners that deploy their app on Hypr Network. [0x1a297afb9373355bb9492e469ca0a531fda87364](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a297afb9373355bb9492e469ca0a531fda87364). The details of the retroactive airdrop is still TBD.

Our goal is to create a network that is owned by its community members, but balanced in a way to also reward developers and users of applications that deploy on Hypr Network.\
\
Our goal is sustainable growth as a network and the 30% in a multisig wallet will allow Hypr to grow responsibly.&#x20;

The Hypr team plans on locking the uniswap v2 LP tokens. In terms of timing, we do not have an ETA on that but, rest assured, we plan on locking liquidity within 7 days of creating the uniswap v2 pool.&#x20;

We are working with Floki team, the creator of Flokifi, the well-known and respected locker for liquidity.&#x20;

  * 2% goes toward staking rewards.
  * 2% goes toward operating expenses such as marketing and business development.
