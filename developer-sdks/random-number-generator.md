# Random Number Generator

The Randao Wrapper VRF Contract is a smart contract interface that can be used to get multiple random numbers.

### The problem we solved

Some smart contract applications need to get random numbers, but currently, most methods of generating random numbers are unsafe on-chain.  The Randao Wrapper VRF Contract provides an interface that can be used to get random numbers safely and these random numbers are generated by multiple random productors safely on-chain. These numbers are completely random and cannot be predicted.

### The Solidity APIs for The Randao Wrapper VRF Contract

We provide interfaces compatible with Chainlink VRF for generating random numbers. These functions can be invoked via Solidity API.\
