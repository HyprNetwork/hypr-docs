If you've added other EVM-compatible networks to MetaMask before, you'll find the process of adding Hypr to be a breeze. Just like any other EVM network, MetaMask allows you to seamlessly integrate Hypr, enabling you to interact with the Hypr ecosystem effortlessly.

After installing the [MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-started-with-MetaMask) browser extension, simply add a new network using the [Hypr network details](network-settings.md).
